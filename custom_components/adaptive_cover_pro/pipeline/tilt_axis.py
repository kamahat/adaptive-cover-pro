"""Tilt-axis overlay composition (issue #514).

A per-slot *tilt-only* custom-position contribution fixes the slat angle
(tilt) without claiming the position axis: solar — or whatever wins the
position pipeline — drives the carriage, while the active tilt-only slot
overlays its configured slat angle onto the winner.

This mirrors :mod:`pipeline.floors`: pure helpers that read a
:class:`PipelineSnapshot` and return plain data. The registry composes the
winning tilt-only contribution after picking a position winner; the overlay
fills the winner's tilt only when it is unset (fill-when-unset, decision Q1b)
so a position-winner that already set an explicit tilt keeps it.

The pass is cover-type-agnostic — it reads ``state.tilt_only`` and never asks
"is this venetian". The venetian-specific behaviour (suppressing the global
tilt-only carriage-close) lives in ``VenetianPolicy.post_pipeline_resolve``,
gated on ``PipelineResult.tilt_only_contribution_active``.
