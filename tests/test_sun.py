"""Tests for `SunData` day-cached property accessors.

Regression guards for issue #437: the original implementation re-ran
`pd.date_range` and the full astral walk on **every** property access,
so a single forecast computation paid ~289 calls per accessor and
``solar_azimuth`` itself paid ~290× per call because the nested
``for _i in self.times`` clause re-evaluated ``self.times`` on every
iteration.

The fix moves the timeline behind a date-keyed memo that invalidates
on day rollover.
