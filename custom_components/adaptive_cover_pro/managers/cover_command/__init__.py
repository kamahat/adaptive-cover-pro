    - Gate checks (auto control, time window, delta, time, manual override)
    - Service call preparation and execution
    - Per-entity state via ``PerEntityState`` (target, waiting, retry_count, ...)
    - Reconciliation timer: every minute, re-sends target if cover missed it
    - Diagnostic tracking (last action, last skipped action)

    Usage:
        1. Call ``start()`` after HA is ready (first refresh).
        2. Call ``apply_position(entity_id, position, reason, context=ctx)``
           whenever the desired position changes.
        3. Call ``stop()`` on shutdown/unload.
        4. Call ``check_target_reached(entity_id, reported_position)`` from
           the coordinator's cover-state-change handler.

            transit_timeout_seconds: Seconds without forward progress before the
                wait_for_target backstop fires.  Defaults to DEFAULT_TRANSIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
                (45s).  Set higher for slow covers that take longer to complete a traverse.
            on_tick: Optional async callable(now) invoked at the start of each
                reconciliation tick. Use for coordinator-level periodic work
                (e.g. time window transition checks) that must run on the same

            event_buffer: Shared diagnostic ring buffer (optional). When provided,
                cover_command_sent and cover_command_skipped events are appended.
            debug_log: Optional ``(category, msg, *args) -> None`` callable used
                by the manual-override classifier so its diagnostic lines respect
                the coordinator's debug-categories gate.  Defaults to plain
                ``logger.debug`` when omitted.

                whenever an outbound position command is dispatched (alongside

                ``AdaptiveCoverManager.note_command_sent`` so time-based
