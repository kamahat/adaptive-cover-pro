# Adaptive Cover Pro

Home Assistant custom integration that controls vertical blinds, horizontal awnings, and venetian (tilt) blinds based on sun position. It filters direct sunlight while maximizing natural light, with climate-aware operation.

> **📖 Full documentation lives on the [Wiki](https://github.com/jrhubott/adaptive-cover-pro/wiki).**

---

## What it does

- **Three cover types:** vertical blinds, horizontal awnings, venetian (tilt)
- **Basic and Climate modes:** geometric sun tracking, plus a temperature-aware strategy for winter, summer, and intermediate seasons
- **10-handler override pipeline:** force override, weather, manual, custom position, motion, cloud suppression, climate, glare zones, solar, default
- **Safety overrides:** force override (rain/wind/fire), weather safety (wind/rain), manual override that pauses on physical, app, or voice moves
- **Always-on diagnostics:** decision trace, sun position, position verification; debug mode without touching YAML
- **15 runtime services** (v2.18.0+): change any setting from automations and scripts without opening the Options UI

## Companion Lovelace card

Pair with the **[Adaptive Cover Pro Card](https://github.com/jrhubott/adaptive-cover-pro-card)**, a custom Lovelace card that visualizes sun vs. window geometry, the full pipeline decision trace, and live cover positions with inline override controls. HACS-installable as a Lovelace plugin. It reads existing entities and calls existing services, so no integration changes are needed.

See the **[Lovelace Card](https://github.com/jrhubott/adaptive-cover-pro/wiki/Lovelace-Card)** wiki page for install, configuration, and usage. All card documentation, including developer setup, is maintained here in the integration wiki.

## Quick install

**HACS (recommended):** In HACS, search **Adaptive Cover Pro**, download, restart Home Assistant, then add the integration.

**Manual:** Copy `custom_components/adaptive_cover_pro/` into `config/custom_components/`, restart Home Assistant, and add the integration.

## Credits

Inspired by and originally forked from **[Adaptive Cover](https://github.com/basbruss/adaptive-cover)** by **[Bas Brussee (@basbruss)](https://github.com/basbruss)**, whose ideation and base implementation started this project. Adaptive Cover Pro has since grown into a substantially different codebase with a new architecture and feature set, but the original work deserves real credit.

Original forum post that inspired both projects: [Automatic Blinds](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/automatic-blinds-sunscreen-control-based-on-sun-platform/).

## How this project is built

Adaptive Cover Pro is developed with substantial help from generative AI, specifically Anthropic's Claude via the Claude Code CLI. As a solo maintainer with limited spare time, AI assistance is what makes it possible to respond to issues, ship features, and keep the test suite green at a pace that wouldn't otherwise be sustainable. Defects will occur, as they would with any software project, but the scope of what this integration covers is far larger than I could have managed alone. I (the maintainer, 30+ years in software) own the architecture, vet every merge, and stay accountable for what ships. The test suite (over 2,500 tests) is the load-bearing safety net for AI-generated changes.

For the full workflow, model routing, code-review gates, and what stays in human hands, see **[AI-Assisted Development](https://github.com/jrhubott/adaptive-cover-pro/wiki/AI-Assisted-Development)** on the wiki.

## For developers

See the **[For Developers](https://github.com/jrhubott/adaptive-cover-pro/wiki/For-Developers)** wiki hub for setup, architecture, workflow, testing strategies, code standards, and the automated release process.
