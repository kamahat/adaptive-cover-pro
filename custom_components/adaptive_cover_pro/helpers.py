    within the astronomical sunset/sunrise window (i.e. after
    ``sunset + sunset_off`` minutes **or** before
    ``sunrise + sunrise_off`` minutes) the sunset position is active.

    Unlike the legacy timer-based approach this function is stateless and
    re-evaluated every coordinator update cycle, so a Home Assistant restart
    during the sunset window immediately returns the correct position without
    any timer re-scheduling.

    Args:
        h_def:      Configured default position (0–100 %).
        sunset_pos: Configured sunset/night position, or ``None`` when not set.
        sun_data:   ``SunData`` instance providing today's sunset/sunrise times.
        sunset_off: Minutes *added* to astronomical sunset before the window opens.
        sunrise_off: Minutes *added* to astronomical sunrise before the window closes.
        sunset_time: Optional override for the sunset boundary (naive-local datetime).
            When provided, replaces the astral-computed sunset. ``sunset_off`` still
            applies on top. Falls back to astral when ``None``.
        sunrise_time: Optional override for the sunrise boundary (naive-local datetime).
            When provided, replaces the astral-computed sunrise. ``sunrise_off`` still
            applies on top. Falls back to astral when ``None``.
        window_explicitly_started: When ``True``, a *real* (non-blank) start_time
            or start entity is configured and has already passed. In that case the
            ``before_sunrise`` branch is suppressed so that a start_time earlier than
            astronomical sunrise (a valid config on short winter days, issue #438)
            does not incorrectly apply the sunset/night position once the user's
            window opens. This is distinct from a window that is merely "open"
            because no start time is set: the blank sentinel ``BLANK_TIME``
            ("00:00:00") must NOT suppress the night position (issue #492), so it
            maps to ``False`` here even though the active-window check treats blank
            as "no start restriction". Defaults to ``False`` for call sites without
            start_time context.
        eval_time: Optional time at which to evaluate the sunset/sunrise window.
            When provided (tz-aware or naive-local), it replaces wall-clock now —
            this lets the forecast project the effective default at each future
            sample time instead of "now". ``None`` (default) preserves the live
            behavior of evaluating against the current moment.
        daytime_gate: Optional override from a configured "daytime gate" (issue
            #632). ``None`` (default, no gate) keeps the astronomical decision —
            zero regression. ``True`` (gate says daytime) forces
            ``is_sunset_active=False`` regardless of astral times (the
            bright-evening / pre-sunrise-dark cases). ``False`` (gate says dark)
            forces ``is_sunset_active=True``. When set, the gate OWNS the boundary
            and short-circuits the astral ``after_sunset``/``before_sunrise`` math
            and the ``window_explicitly_started`` branch.
        end_of_window_pos: Optional end-of-window position (0–100, issue #625) or
            ``None`` (default, disabled — zero regression). When set AND
            ``end_of_window_active`` is ``True`` it overrides the astronomical
            effective default with a TWO-PHASE astral handoff:
              - When ``sunset_pos`` is also set: the end-of-window position holds
                from window-end UNTIL astral sunset (phase 1, gated on
                ``not after_sunset``), then the astral ``sunset_pos`` takes over
                (phase 2, automatic fall-through).
              - When ``sunset_pos`` is ``None`` (no handoff target): the
                end-of-window position persists the whole evening (a top-of-body
                short-circuit that outranks even a configured ``daytime_gate``).
            A configured ``daytime_gate`` still OWNS the boundary in the
            ``sunset_pos`` set case (phase 1 does not override it).
        end_of_window_active: ``True`` when the operating window is clock-closed
            (now is at/after the configured/entity end time). Only meaningful when
            ``end_of_window_pos`` is set. Defaults to ``False``.

    Returns:
        A ``(effective_default, is_sunset_active)`` tuple where
