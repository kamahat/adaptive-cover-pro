"""One-shot entity registry migrations for Adaptive Cover Pro.

Each migration runs at most once per config entry, tracked by a flag stored in
entry.options.  Migrations must be idempotent — safe to call again if the flag
is somehow missing.

Idempotency contract
--------------------
* The flag is written to ``entry.options`` **before** any registry mutations.
* If a crash occurs between the flag write and the first ``async_remove`` call
  the migration will never re-run (flag is already set) — entities in that
  window would linger as unavailable ghosts.  This is the safer trade-off vs.
  the alternative (writing after removal), which could cause a partial removal
  loop on every restart until all targeted entities are gone.
* Both migrations collect the list of entities to remove before mutating
  anything, so the INFO log that follows reflects the actual work done.
