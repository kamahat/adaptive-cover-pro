"""Floor-mode composition helpers (issue #463).

A "floor" is a minimum-position clamp contributed by an *active* override —
custom-position slot with ``min_mode``, weather override with ``min_mode``,
or force override with ``min_mode`` — that must raise whichever handler
ultimately wins the pipeline, regardless of priority.

These helpers are pure: they read a :class:`PipelineSnapshot` and return
plain data. The registry composes the active floors after picking a winner;
the coordinator's user-move clamp consumes the same helpers so the
``max(active_floors)`` arithmetic exists in exactly one place.
