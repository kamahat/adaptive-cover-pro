    """Return a configured position when this slot's binary sensor is active.

    One instance is created per configured custom position slot (up to 4).
    Each instance carries its own sensor entity_id, target position, and
    pipeline priority so the PipelineRegistry can sort them correctly relative
    to all other handlers.

    Priority is configurable (1–99, default 77) so users can choose where in
    the decision chain each custom position activates:
    - Priority > 80  → overrides manual override too
    - Priority 77    → default: between manual override (80) and motion timeout (75)
    - Priority < 40  → evaluated after solar tracking

    The handler matches by looking up its sensor entity_id in
    ``snapshot.custom_position_sensors`` (a list of
    :class:`CustomPositionSensorState` entries).  If the sensor is
    ``is_on=True`` it claims the position; otherwise it passes through.
