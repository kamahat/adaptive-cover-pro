"""Cover-state-change classification for manual-override detection.

`StateClassifier` is the single piece of code that decides whether a
post-command cover state change represents the integration's own transit
(grace period, mid-transit pause, forward progress, settle) or genuine
user activity (manual override).  The logic stays *byte-for-byte
equivalent* to the body that lived inline on the coordinator before this
extraction — every issue-fix comment is preserved verbatim.  Refactoring
this code is not in scope; relocating it is.

Background — the inline implementation accumulated five issue-numbered
behaviour fixes over its lifetime:

- **#147** — clearing wait_for_target on intermediate states caused
  user-initiated moves to be mis-attributed to ACP.
- **#172** — startup motor-engagement delay must keep wait_for_target so
  ACP-commanded covers aren't false-flagged before they move.
- **#186** — step-motor covers briefly report a non-transitional state
  between pulses; restart the grace period instead of clearing.
- **#271** — progress-aware backstop: clear wait_for_target only after
  *transit_timeout* seconds without forward progress, so slow-but-moving
  covers are not prematurely cleared.
- **#285** — direction/progress check runs for covers that never emit
  "opening"/"closing", based purely on position delta.

The classifier is composed by :class:`CoverCommandService` and accessed
through its public :meth:`classify_state_change` wrapper.  External state
flows in as keyword arguments:

- ``target_just_reached`` is a ``set[str]`` owned by the coordinator and
  *mutated in place* — the coordinator reads it from another handler
  inside the same event lifecycle, and changing that contract is out of
  scope for this phase.
- ``grace_mgr`` is the same :class:`GracePeriodManager` the cover
  command service already composes; it is passed by argument here so the
  classifier never reaches back into the service for it.

        Some cover firmware reports the commanded target position immediately
        (before the motor moves), then updates to the real intermediate position
        as the carriage travels.  When the grace period expires, the classifier
        sees ``old_position == target`` (the optimistic report) and
        ``position != target`` (the real intermediate), computing
        ``old_distance = 0``, ``new_distance > 0`` — which the direction/progress
        block misidentifies as drift-away and incorrectly clears ``wait_for_target``.

        Detection signature: ``old_position == target AND position != target``
        AND still within the 45-second transit-timeout backstop window.  The
        backstop is the ultimate safety net: an optimistic cover that stalls
        off-target is still cleared after 45 s.  True drift-away (Issue #285)
        always starts from ``old_position != target``, so this guard leaves that
        case untouched.

        Returns:
            ``True`` if the guard fired and ``classify`` should return immediately
            (``wait_for_target`` is kept), ``False`` otherwise.
