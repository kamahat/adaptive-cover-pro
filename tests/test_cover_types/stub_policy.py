"""Shared synthetic cover-type policies used as parametrize fodder.

These are hypothetical "fifth cover types" — they satisfy the
``CoverTypePolicy`` ABC with only the abstract method overridden, and serve
as canaries for the invariant: code outside ``cover_types/`` must tolerate
a registered policy it has never heard of.

If a future change to coordinator / managers / pipeline / config_flow /
sensor / switch / binary_sensor introduces an assumption that crashes for
an unknown cover type, the tests parametrising over ``ALL_POLICIES_WITH_STUBS``
catch it before the real fifth cover type lands.
