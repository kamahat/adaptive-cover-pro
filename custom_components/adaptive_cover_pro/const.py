"""Constants for the Adaptive Cover Pro integration.

Every public symbol the rest of the package depends on lives here. The file is
organized into named sections (banner-style headers below) and every constant
carries an inline comment with its unit, range, default, or role.

Conventions
-----------
* ``CONF_*`` constants hold the wire-format key under which an option is
  persisted in ``config_entry.options``. These strings are stored in the user's
  Home Assistant config and **must stay byte-stable** across releases — renaming
  the Python name is fine, renaming the string value is not.
* ``DEFAULT_*`` constants are the value applied when the corresponding option is
  unset.
* Private ``_RANGE_*`` tuples are ``(min, max)`` bounds used only inside this
  module to build ``OPTION_RANGES`` — the single source of truth that
  ``config_flow.py`` selectors and ``services/options_service.py`` validators
  both consume.
* ``ATTR_*`` constants are HA service-call attribute keys.

# Targets 1-99 still use set_cover_position. Falls back to set_cover_position
# when the cover lacks open/close, and never applies to a tilt-only axis.

# =============================================================================
# Sampling cadence and boundary-event vocabulary for the dashboard forecast
# strip built by ``forecast.build_forecast``. 15-minute steps over the full

# when its left AND right are both set; the master CONF_ENABLE_BLIND_SPOT still
# gates the whole feature. Slot 1 REUSES the legacy unsuffixed keys above so
# existing installs need no migration; slots 2/3 use ``_2``/``_3`` suffixes.

# Per-slot elevation modes (issue #702). "below" (default) keeps today's
# ``sol_elev <= elevation`` — an obstacle that blocks LOW sun (tree, overhang).

# HIGH sun (balcony, deep recess). The vocabulary is slot-independent: it lives
# here ONCE and is never re-suffixed per slot.

# After a position command lands, the service polls current_position every
# poll-interval seconds, declares the cover "settled" when the position matches
# the target within the standard tolerance OR has not changed for three

# ``stamp_position_command``). Somfy IO actuators in issue #33 publish their
# back-rotate tilt burst ~27 s after settle; 45 s leaves ~18 s headroom for
# slower bus republish on KNX/Z2M while staying well under
# VENETIAN_TILT_SUPPRESSION_SECONDS=90.0. Anchored to the real settle
# transition (not stamp_position_command), so a premature-stall on a slow-start
# actuator cannot start this clock early.
#
# Behavioural-impact note: fast actuators (KNX sub-second publish, Shelly 2PM)
# settle and publish back-rotate inside VENETIAN_POST_SETTLE_CAP_GRACE_SECONDS=5.0
# today, so extending publish-lag to 45 s does change behaviour: a user
# twisting slats by hand at +10 s post-settle would, under the new code, be
# classed as motor back-drive and not trip override — if their delta exceeds
# 30 (the cap). Risk bounded by physics: real motor back-drive is
# single-digit-percent (VENETIAN_REBASE_MAX_DRIFT_PERCENT=15), so a delta of
# 30-95% during the 5-45 s window is implausible on any actuator. A user
# twisting slats during the window almost always lands within the existing cap
# (delta ≤ 30) which has always suppressed regardless of actuator speed.
