"""Skip reason guard tests.

Two guards in one module:

1. Skip-code exhaustiveness — the canonical set of reason codes embedded here
   must match every ``_skip()`` call site in cover_command.py. Fails when a new
   skip code is added or an old one removed without updating _EXPECTED_SKIP_CODES.

2. Always-present keys — every skip code must produce a ``last_skipped_action``
   dict that contains all 7 always-present keys documented in CLAUDE.md. Fails
   when ``record_skipped_action()`` is changed in a way that drops a required key.

When you add a new skip code:
  - Add the reason string to _EXPECTED_SKIP_CODES below
  - Update the always-present-keys test if the new code produces extras
  - Update the CLAUDE.md "last_skipped_action Dict Structure" section
