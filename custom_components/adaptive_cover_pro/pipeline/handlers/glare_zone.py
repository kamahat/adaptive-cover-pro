"""Glare zone handler — lower blind to protect specific floor zones from glare.

Fix: use min() (closest zone) instead of max() (farthest zone) for zone
selection. The closest zone demands the most blind coverage because smaller
effective distance → lower position% → more blind deployed.
Thanks to @ZamenWolk for identifying this in GitHub issue #213.

    Only applies to vertical covers (cover_blind). Computes effective distances
    for all active glare zones using pure geometry, then returns a position
    based on the minimum (closest) zone distance when it is less than the
    cover's base distance.

    ClimateHandler defers its GLARE_CONTROL case (returns None), so this
    handler fires naturally when climate mode is on and the sun is tracking.
    When climate mode is off, this handler fires directly after time-window
    and cover-type gates.

    Geometry: smaller effective distance → lower position% → more blind deployed.
    A zone closer to the window than the base distance is in the illuminated area
    and needs the blind lowered further than SolarHandler would compute.

    Falls through to SolarHandler (returns None) when all zones are at or beyond
    the base distance (already in shadow from normal solar tracking).
