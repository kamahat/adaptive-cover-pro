# Adaptive Cover Pro

Sun-tracking cover automation with an inspectable decision pipeline, full venetian sequencing, glare zones, and a seasonal climate arbiter — for Home Assistant.

> Full documentation lives on the [Wiki](https://github.com/jrhubott/adaptive-cover-pro/wiki).

---

## What it does

- **Four cover types with full geometric modeling** — vertical blinds, horizontal awnings, tilt-only blinds, and venetian blinds; each uses real window and facade geometry, not rules of thumb.
- **Inspectable decision pipeline** — 10 handlers run in priority order (safety, weather, manual, climate, glare, solar) and each reports its reason. A `decision_trace` sensor shows exactly why the cover is at 45% — no black boxes.
- **Venetian blinds done properly** — dual-axis sequencer waits for the carriage to settle before sending tilt, handles back-rotation across a 45-second post-settle window, and pre-positions tilt on opening to eliminate flicker. Covers KNX, Shelly, and Somfy IO buses.
- **Climate mode with a full seasonal arbiter** — winter heating, winter insulation, summer cooling, and glare comfort each have independent logic; presence, lux, irradiance, and cloud cover are all suppression inputs.
- **Glare zones** — name the floor areas you want protected (TV, dining table); the cover deploys further than pure sun tracking when a protected zone would receive direct sun.
- **15 runtime services** — every parameter is scriptable from automations; no UI interaction needed to change mode, position limits, or overrides at runtime.

## Companion Lovelace card

The **[Adaptive Cover Pro Card](https://github.com/jrhubott/adaptive-cover-pro-card)** turns the integration's sensors into a dashboard you can read at a glance. It's HACS-installable and ships three cards in one bundle.

**Sky compass** — watch the sun cross each window in real time: its arc through the field of view, the shaded wedge of the cover closing to track it, sunrise and sunset, and the day's elevation curve underneath.

**Tile card** — one compact row per shade: icon, live position, `↑ ■ ▼` controls, and a badge that tells you which automation is driving the cover right now (Auto, Solar tracking, a Manual override with its expiry and a resume button, Motion, and more). Tap any tile for the full pipeline trace, today's forecast, the compass, and override controls.

**Full card** — everything in one place: the compass, the elevation chart, the pipeline decision strip with the winning handler highlighted, per-cover position bars, and override controls.

## Quick install

**HACS (recommended):** In HACS, search **Adaptive Cover Pro**, download, restart Home Assistant, then add the integration.

**Manual:** Copy `custom_components/adaptive_cover_pro/` into `config/custom_components/`, restart Home Assistant, and add the integration.
