"""Pure data shapes for cover_command's per-entity state.

These dataclasses are the contract between the orchestrator
(:class:`CoverCommandService`) and the cover-positioning lifecycle
(reconciliation, manual override, diagnostics).

Keeping them in a leaf module — no imports from the rest of the package —
breaks any latent circular-import risk and makes it cheap for managers,
diagnostics, and tests to depend on the shapes without dragging in the
whole service.

Today this file holds the dataclasses only. The companion
``EntityStateStore`` wrapper that owns the ``dict[str, PerEntityState]``
and the typed accessor methods is still on :class:`CoverCommandService`;
extracting it is the natural follow-up once the rest of the seams have
moved.
