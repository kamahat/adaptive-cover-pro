"""Shared Building Profile link helpers.

A neutral home for the profile/cover linkage helpers so both ``config_flow``
(link/unlink UI) and ``__init__`` (live propagation + deletion cleanup) can
reuse a single source. It must not live in ``helpers.py`` — that module is
imported by ``cover_types.base``, and these helpers need ``get_policy`` from
``cover_types``, which would create an import cycle.
