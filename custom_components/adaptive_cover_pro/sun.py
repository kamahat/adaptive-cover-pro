"""Fetch sun data.

`SunData` caches the day's solar timeline (`pd.date_range` plus the
per-tick azimuth/elevation lists from astral) so a single property read
doesn't pay the full ~289-call astral walk every time. The cache is
keyed on `(timezone, lat, lon, elevation, date.today())` — it
self-invalidates at midnight without any explicit refresh.

This shape exists because `position_forecast` (and any future
forecast-style consumer) reads ``solar_azimuth`` / ``solar_elevation``
in a tight loop. The plain `@property` form recomputed everything on
every access, with a nested ``for _i in self.times`` clause that
re-evaluated ``self.times`` on every iteration — pathological inside
a 49-step forecast walker. See issue #437.

The module-level ``_DAY_CACHE`` shares one fill across all ``SunData``
instances at the same location (e.g. 10 covers at the same address).
The fill runs inside ``hass.async_add_executor_job`` (off the event
loop), so the cache is guarded by a ``threading.Lock``. See issue #441.
