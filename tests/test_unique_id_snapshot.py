"""Snapshot test that locks every entity unique_id produced by Adaptive Cover Pro.

This is the contract that protects against unique_id drift during the
sensor/switch/binary_sensor refactor (see plan: dict-driven spec/factory).

The test boots a config entry that exercises every conditional gate
(climate_mode, motion sensors, force-override, glare zones, etc.) and asserts
that the sorted set of `unique_id`s in the entity registry equals an exact
literal. Any rename, addition, or removal of an entity's unique_id will fail
this test — which is exactly what we want, because user installations carry
state keyed by these strings.

If you intentionally add or rename an entity, update both the literal here
and `migrations.py` so existing installs keep their history.
